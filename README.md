# RentalMarks_B2B_🏢

_____________________________________________________

RentalMarks B2B is the other side of RentalMarks that's designed for B2B companies. The app allows users, who are companies, to add products, follow purchase and reservation requests, respond to messages, and track statistics.

The app is entirely developed using Flutter and Dart 🚀, and BloC is used for state management. 💻📈

The app is connected to a private server's SQL database through an API, and the website uses the same setup. DIO package in Flutter is used to interact with the API, and it's working seamlessly with the API. 💻🔍

In the future, we're open to any new ideas and features that align with the company's priorities. The project is left entirely open for anyone who wants to use or develop it. 🌟
